# Invoice Label Detection 🧾🔍

This repository contains a lightweight tool for detecting and labeling fields on invoice documents using a YOLO-based object detection model. It is designed to process scanned invoices and highlight specific fields such as dates, totals, vendor names, and other relevant labels with bounding boxes.

## 🚧 Project Status

**This project is currently under active development.**  
Expect improvements, code refactoring, and feature additions in the upcoming commits.

## 📦 Features

- Object detection using a custom-trained YOLO model (`best.pt`)
- Visualizes bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores
- Works with JPEG images (can be extended for PDF/PNG)
- Lightweight and fast inference
